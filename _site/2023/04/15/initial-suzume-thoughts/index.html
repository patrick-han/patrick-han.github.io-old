<p>This review contains spoilers. Actually it’s more of a rambling than a review, so don’t expect much.</p>

<p>I recently had the pleasure of watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzume">Suzume</a>, Makoto Shinkai’s latest film. A short summary of my initial thoughts is this:</p>

<p>Suzume is a great film that suffers from a struggle between the message it’s trying to deliver, and having a cohesive and believable world.</p>

<h1 id="visuals">Visuals</h1>

<p>Shinkai really outdid himself on this one. In short, it’s beautiful as we’ve come to expect from his films. Sure it has the same played on themes that the previous two movies had (weather, nature, Japanese rural aesthetics, etc.). But hey, it’s something he does really well, and probably better than anyone else, and I’m a believer that you can still tell many unique stories within the same setting. There’s a decent amount of CG in the movie, but it was all pretty good and none of it was distracting. The doors are a really great compositional element and they know it.</p>

<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<p>Not exactly a musician myself, but there are definitely some really memorable themes – something I can’t really say about Suzume’s predecessor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering_with_You">Weathering with You</a>.</p>

<h1 id="story">Story</h1>
<p>To just get into the meat of it, the second half of the movie had me scratching my head wondering why things happened the way they did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why didn’t Daijin just turn back into the keystone earlier?</li>
  <li>Where did Sadaijin come from? Presumably it’s the other keystone, but who released it? Did it just come undone on its own? Suzume also seems shockingly unfazed by its appearance.</li>
  <li>It’s implied Souta’s grandfather knew Sadaijin, but what was their relationship, and how does it relate to the apparently long-running lineage of being a Closer?</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to name a few. Now, I’m a firm believer that the message a story delivers takes precendence above all. Not everything has to be explained, not every piece of lore about a world needs to fleshed out in its entirety. But when things unexplained become distracting from the main story, I find that to be something worth critiquing, and I believe that’s the case here.</p>

<p>The cats almost feel like placement for merchandise rather than creatures I’m supposed to be intrigued of or caring for. I get that Sadaijin is used as a plot device to help Suzume and her aunt confess their true feelings, but did we really need a giant black magic cat for that to happen? Outside of that, it just magically appears as the other keystone and we’re supposed to accept that as fact. There might be some cultural context I’m missing here about cats, but I really felt like the film could have used an extra 30 minutes for some exposition on the whole thing about being Closers and where these cats came from in the first place. They gave us a taste of it when Suzume and Souta journey back to Souta’s apartment, but I’m lefting wanting for a little more.</p>

<p>All of that said though, the overall story about Suzume dealing with her past trauma is touching. The strangers and new friends she meets along her journey, as well as the increasingly worried actions her aunt takes, all build up to a really nice climax during their argument where each is forced to communicate and resolve their feelings.</p>

<p>As many others have pointed out, 3/11 refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">2011 earthquake and tsunami</a> in Japan that killed nearly 20,000 people. I’m sure Suzume’s story resonates even more with the Japanese in this regard.</p>

<p>Finally, I really like the idea that earthquakes (or just death) in general can happen at any time. The scenes of the worm floating above the cities in the movie with everyone completely oblivious to the fact is a nice visual.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I’ll really have to think about this one a little more, because I really do think this is a movie that has an appreciable amount of substance to it outside of the typical “girl meets boy and they are figuratively or literally reaching out towards each other”. It’s just a shame that there are parts of the story I think could be appreciated a little more had the movie been given an extra 30 minutes or so of breathing room. In fact, I think we should normalize longer movies (and intermissions). Too many movies have been disappointing in this exact same way, because of some feeling of needing to conform to this arbitrary 2 hour standard. I’m not the biggest fan of James Cameron’s Avatar, but I respect his opinions on long movies in this regard.</p>
